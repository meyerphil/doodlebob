## TODO:
### UI:
 * design home page
 * add active players window on canvas page
 * make canvas resize to fill page when window resized without clearing it
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47694631/p5-resize-window-without-clearing-the-background
 * change general.js p_scale based on velocity (maybe?) (would need to add p_scale to server messages)
### Server:
 * add reconnect ability to websockets on client side
 * drop dead connections
